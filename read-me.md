**Nic's Simple Calculator**

A Simple Calculator built with php, JavaScript, HTML & CSS to do basic calculations

Maybe add clear_input() button back - was originally where the sqroot button is

Making a few versions of this:
1. simple-calculator.php (table)
2. nic-calculator.php (flex)
3. scientic-calculator.php (still to come)
